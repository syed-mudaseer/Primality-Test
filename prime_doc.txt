Algorithm: Miller-Robin Algorithm

It is a probablistic algorithm with Time Comlexity of O(log3(n)) which is significantly faster than current deterministic AKS test. Currently it is the fastest method for primality testing.

As it is a probablisitc method, initial error rate is .25 when iter=1.
As iteration increases the error rate decreases.

Optimal iterations=40.Thus error rate= (0.24)^40 which is close to 0.

This error rate is good for a exchange of speed with accuracy.
